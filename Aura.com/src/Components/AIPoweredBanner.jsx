            At the heart of NetHavenâ„¢ is advanced artificial intelligence that constantly learns from 
            new threats and adapts its protection in real time. Unlike static parental controls that 
            rely on outdated blocklists, NetHavenâ„¢ uses AI to identify emerging risks â€” from newly 
            launched harmful websites to suspicious keywords in chats â€” and responds instantly.
            <br /><br />
            This means your childâ€™s protection gets smarter every day, staying ahead of the 
            ever-changing digital world.
