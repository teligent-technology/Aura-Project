      Scams evolve fast â€” and most people donâ€™t know until itâ€™s too late.

      Scam Alerts Hub keeps you informed in real time about the latest scam trends spreading across the country â€” from refund scams and fake tech support calls, to investment scams, romance traps, and phishing websites.

    <div className="reality-point">
      Alerts are sent through the Hub, by email, or even over the phone â€” always in plain language, and always with one goal:<br />
      To warn you before the scam reaches you.
