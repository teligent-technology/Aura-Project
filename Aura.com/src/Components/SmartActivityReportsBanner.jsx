            NetHavenâ„¢ compiles clear, easy-to-read reports that highlight the most important 
            details about your childâ€™s online activity. Powered by AI, these reports filter 
            out noise and focus on what matters â€” the websites visited, apps used, screen 
            time patterns, and any flagged safety concerns.
            <br /><br />
            Delivered to your dashboard (and optionally to your email), Smart Activity Reports 
            give you the insights you need to guide safe, healthy digital habits without sifting 
            through endless data.
