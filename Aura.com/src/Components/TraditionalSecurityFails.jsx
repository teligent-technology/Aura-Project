            <div className="fails-point">
              🛑 It doesn’t block full-screen pop-up scams
              <p>Fake alerts that freeze your screen and display urgent phone numbers still slip through.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fails-point">
              🛑 It doesn’t detect refund scams or impersonation calls
              <p>Scammers pretending to be from Amazon, Microsoft, or your bank go completely unnoticed.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fails-point">
              🛑 It doesn’t stop remote access traps
              <p>Tools like AnyDesk and TeamViewer are often misused — traditional security rarely flags them.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fails-point">
              🛑 It doesn’t warn you about fake websites
              <p>Scammers copy the exact look of PayPal, your bank, or antivirus companies.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fails-point">
              🛑 It doesn’t keep up with evolving scam tactics
              <p>Most protection relies on signature updates — but scam methods change every week.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fails-point">
              🛑 It doesn’t protect decision-making — only files
              <p>It can't warn you when you're being manipulated by a voice that sounds trustworthy.</p>
