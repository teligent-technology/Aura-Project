              <h2 className="about-heading">Our Story</h2>
              <p className="about-text">
                We were founded and proudly incorporated in Dover, Delaware, in April 2016 — starting out as a dedicated American business with one mission: to provide honest, reliable IT support and a trusted online software store for home users, small businesses, and professionals.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                In the beginning, our services were offered exclusively within the United States, built on the values of integrity, personal care, and results you can count on. As word spread, our commitment to treating every customer like family carried us far beyond U.S. borders. Today, we’re privileged to serve customers across Canada and American retirees in Mexico, Panama, and Costa Rica — keeping them safe, connected, and supported, no matter where in the world they call home.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                But as the digital landscape changed, so did the threats. We saw scams, hacking, and identity theft reaching deeper into people’s lives — especially targeting seniors and vulnerable communities. It became clear that traditional tech support wasn’t enough anymore.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                That’s why we created DefendMePro™ — our all-in-one digital protection service. It combines expert IT support, advanced cyber-threat blocking, fraud prevention, and scam defence into a single, trusted solution.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                Whether we’re fixing your computer, solving a tech issue at your business, stopping a scam in its tracks, or protecting your entire family’s digital life, our mission is simple and unwavering: To keep you, your family, and your business safe — and to give you complete peace of mind in today’s connected world.

                At Saffron Guru, our mission is simple but urgent: to stop scams before they reach you. Scams are spreading faster than ever. In 2024 alone, Americans lost over $16 billion to online fraud. Seniors, veterans, and families are targeted every day by hackers, impostors, and cybercriminals.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                We exist to protect the people most at risk—older adults, vulnerable families, and small businesses—by building a digital safety wall around their lives. Our purpose is not just support—we provide complete online protection and, most importantly, peace of mind.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                Every call we take, every tool we build, every scam we block is driven by one mission: 👉 To give you safety, trust, and freedom in today’s digital age.
