          <p className="scam-intro">
            A retiree lost nearly her entire Social Security check to a fake “Microsoft technician”

              <h2>🧠 How It Started</h2>
              <p>
                The scam began when the woman’s computer screen turned black and displayed a number
                claiming to be from Microsoft. The caller sounded calm and professional.

              <p>
                She was told her funds were missing and directed to store after store, buying gift
                cards and sharing the PINs. Almost $3,000 vanished before she realized the truth.

              <h2>📉 Behind the Numbers</h2>
              <p>
                According to the FTC, imposter scams cost consumers $2.95 billion in 2024, with the
                most losses stemming from such scams—even more than investment scams.

              <h2>✅ Staying Safe</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Never give computer access to unsolicited callers claiming to fix your device.
                </li>
                <li>Don’t buy gift cards for someone instructing you over the phone.</li>
                <li>
                  Always verify by contacting known agency numbers—not the ones they provide.
                </li>
              </ul>

              While this was a heartbreaking loss, the woman shares her story so others don’t fall
              for similar traps. Be safe, and verify before trusting.
